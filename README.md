# Logging to Logtail with Pino

This project aim to collect some log with Pino to the Logtail platform.

I've followed the guide present on Logtail website. I've found only one problem. Actually it doesnt provide a way to send the log to the platform during the development phase. I've used pino-http-send in order to achieve this goal. Keep in mind that it's a legacy transport.
