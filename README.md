# Logging to Logtail with Pino

This project aim to have fun with pino and log something to Logtail.

I've followed the guide present on Logtail website. I've found only one problem. Actually it doesnt provide a way to send the log to the platform during the development phase. I've used pino-http-send in order to achieve this goal. Keep in mind that it's a legacy transport.
